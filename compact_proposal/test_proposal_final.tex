Is there a difference between this text and some nonsense like ``Huardest gefburn''? Kjift â€“ not at all!
A blind text like this gives you information about the \mnote{margin note can be used without highlighting} selected font, how the letters are written. A cnote with no arguments is at the end of this sentence\cnote.
A cnote with optional text is here:\cnote[this is optional cnote text] done!
This text should contain all letters of the alphabet and it should be written \mnote[This is optionally highlighted mnote text]{This is a margin note.} the original language.
Pnote is used in this sentence here with no arguments: \pnote and that was it! ...but the length of words \pnote[this is a personal inline note] should match the language.
